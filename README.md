For the project 4, scraped news articles from NYT and the Guardian, and used trump's Twitter posts on China-Us Trade. Analyzed scraped text using natural language processing including sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Utilized SQL, NLTK, TextBlob, and Spacy for data storage and analysis

### Goal: 

Using data we scrape from the web, what can we learn about our data via unsupervised learning techniques? Extend analysis by combining unsupervised and supervised learning methods and natural language processing(NLP) techniques

### Skills:

 * mongodb/sql
 * web scraping
 * dimensionality reduction
 * topic modeling
 


### Analysis:

 * unsupervised learning (clustering and/or dimensionality reduction) or other types of modeling
